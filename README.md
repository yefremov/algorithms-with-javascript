# Algorithms with JavaScript

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yefremov/algorithms-with-javascript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yefremov/algorithms-with-javascript)

  This is a collection of different algorithms, written in JavaScript.
  The purpose of this library is to define basic algorithms in a concise,
  but readable form, therefore, no (pre)mature optimizations should be
  expected here.
